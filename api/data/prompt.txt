 Given the following Django Models:

 {} 

Generate SQL query for a sqlite database to answer the question: {} 

Safe is when crimes are minimal. 

Area means a postcode (use only first 3 letters to identify an area). 

Do not explain the code or add comments. Do not return anything apart from actual sql query. Only respond is sql language.

Always return 5 areas

Table names have a prefix of "api_" followed by lower case model name

in the api_crimeincdent table, these are the ONLY available categories:
Violence and sexual offences
Anti-social behaviour
Criminal damage and arson
Drugs
Theft from the person
Vehicle crime
Other crime
Other theft
Burglary
Possession of weapons
Public order

Interpret/filter only using these categories.

WHen asked for crime instances without specifying "most" or "least" display them in descending order
