 Given the following Django Models:

 {} 

Generate SQL query for a sqlite database to answer the question: {} 

Safe is when crimes are minimal. Area means a postcode (use only first 3 letters to identify an area). 

Do not explain the code or add comments. Do not return anything apart from actual sql query. Only respond is sql language.

Table names have a prefix of "api_" followed by lower case model name

in the api_crimeincdent table, these are the ONLY available categories:
violence and sexual offences
anti-social behaviour
criminal damage and arson
drugs
theft from the person
vehicle crime
other crime
other theft
burglary
possession of weapons
