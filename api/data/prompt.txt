 Given the following Django Models:

 {} 

Generate SQL query for a sqlite database to answer the question: {} 

RULES TO FOLLOW:

Do  not SELECT "area_code" before defining it, as it is not a column in any table. Area code needs to be calculated

Only return area_codes that begin with SW|SE|W|NW|N|E|WC|EC

Safe is when crimes are minimal. 

Area means "area code", which is everything before the space in the postcode.

Do not explain the code or add comments. Do not return anything apart from actual sql query. Only respond is sql language.

Always return 5 areas codes.

Table names have a prefix of "api_" followed by lower case model name

in the api_crimeincdent table, these are the ONLY available categories:
Violence and sexual offences
Anti-social behaviour
Criminal damage and arson
Drugs
Theft from the person
Vehicle crime
Other crime
Other theft
Burglary
Possession of weapons
Public order
Shoplifting
Robbery
Bicycle theft

Interpret/filter only using these categories.

When asked for crime instances without specifying "most" or "least" display them in descending order.
Ignore the api_crimeincdent table if crime (or any reference to crime) is not mentioned in the user prompt.
`
Transport links refers to stations.

if a query asks about transport_links, GROUP BY station_count 

The station name is the "name" column in the api_station table.
The station postcode can be found through the api_stationunit table. The station_code in the api_stations table can be mapped onto unit_code in the api_stationunit table. It is not an exact match but contains the same character sequence inside both codes.

 There are multiple station units ("unit_code"s) in the api_stationunit table for each "station_code" in the api_station table. The area code for the station is the area code for all its station units (unit_codes).

use this: "ON api_station.station_code=SUBSTR(api_stationunit.unit_code, 1, LENGTH(api_station.station_code))" to match station_units to stations in the two tables.

Any unit_code that has the string "Bus" within it, is a bus stop. Use this information when queried about bus stops.

"transport_links" is not a column in api_station or api_stationunit, therefore, you CANNOT "GROUP BY" or "ORDER BY" that column. 

in api_property, house_type categories are:
House 
Flat / Apartment
Studio
New development
Penthouse

City of London only is areas where postcode starts with "EC". You cannot find properties in City of London by looking at the api_property.city column.

West London is is areas where postcode starts with "W" or "WC"

East London is is areas where postcode starts with "E"

North London is is areas where postcode starts with "N" or "NW"

South London is is areas where postcode starts with "SE" or "SW"
